1.	 Abstract
	This application based project has the objective of doing sales analysis on a variety of pharmaceutical data using various data visualization tools like matplotlib library in python and tableau. This project also uses various machine learning models to analyze sales data and make future predictions based on the historical data collected. At last it answers a particular set of questions proposed by the company which would help the company in making decisions regarding their future plans. 
2. Introduction 
Analysing sales data and predicting future sales based on historical data is a very common data science task. One of the problems of pharmaceutical distribution companies (PDCs) is how to control inventory levels in order to prevent costs of excessive inventory and to prevent losing customers due to drug shortage. Consequently, the purpose of this study is to propose a novel method to forecast sales of PDCs.
Actually, PDCs are facing several challenges, including huge amount of inventory, increased competition, and tough regulations that limit advertising. They have to meet their customers’ needs by delivering the right amount of medicines to the right place and at the right time. In PDCs, both shortage and surplus of goods can lead to loss of income for these companies. Accordingly, one of the problems in PDCs is how much quantity of each drug should be kept in the inventory.
